# PID

Kills inactive processes.

# Usage
* Download or git clone

# #Compile
* gcc -o executor -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

# #Execute
* ./executor

# #Tip
* You may need to execute more than once to kill some processes.
* When this program is executed too simultaneously, it may end up killing the parent process, which automatically ends the Shell session.
